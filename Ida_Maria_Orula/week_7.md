### Preparation tasks for lecture on 20.10.2020

#### 1) Arguments

**PRO**
* State charts can help explain complex processes

**CON**
* Trying to model very many different states can be a nightmare

It makes sense to use state charts for explaining parts of complex systems but not for showing the entire huge system in one diagram.

#### 2) The videos

**Group 9 PRO**

My Bachelor's thesis had to do with finite state machines so it was nice to revisit that topic. The main thing I learned from the video is that state charts can lead to less bugs.

**Group 11 PRO**

I learned that clustering is used to show bigger and more complex systems.

**Group 7 CON**

Notation can cause confusions once again. An object might get stuck at some state. 

**Group 10 CON**

State charts can become very complex as they have many states.

### Lab reflection

It is nice to get extra time for the exercises - we need it.
