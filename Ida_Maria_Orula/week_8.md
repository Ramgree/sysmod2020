### Lecture on 27.10

#### 1) Even Storming with Alberto Brandolini <br>
* In which contexts does Alberto use the term model or modeling during this presentation (try to at least find three - there are more)?

* How does Event Storming relate to the UML?

* What is the goal of Event Storming in terms of software development and understanding?

* What does Bruce Lee have to do with all this?

#### 2) Breakout room

**Notes for Group Nr 3**

Moderator: Sander Jenk

Note-Taker: Karel Roots

Members: Sander Jenk, Karel Roots, Martin Põhjakivi, Ida Maria Orula, Karina Sein, Vera Akinyi Onunda, yauheni

**Opening Notes: **
Welcome to breakout room 3. Our topic is Activity diagrams, let us begin. <br>

**First Person Pro Notes: **
Martin: helps with visualizing complex sequential algorithms. It has similar benefits as flowcharts.

**Second Person Con Notes: **
Ida Maria: The activity diagrams are not usually object orientated. We can’t be sure how these activities map to specific objects and it would be difficult to use them for modelling objects.

**Third Person Pro Notes: **
Karina: Parallel behaviour and multi-threaded programming can be easily depicted.

**Fourth Person Con Notes: **
Ida Maria: These diagrams can get visually a bit messy. For example conditionals can lead to a lot of different branches and if it is not well thought-through the diagram can be hard to read.

**Moderator Summary Notes: **
I think we have good points from both sides and we can move on to challenges.

**Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes: **
Karel: Objects can actually be modelled in Activity Diagrams by using Object nodes.

**Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes: **
Ida Maria: Yes, it is possible, but most of the activity diagrams do not use objects. So theoretically then can be used to represent objects, but in practice it is not used as much.

**Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes: **
Sander: Keeping the diagram clean is more of a responsibility of the designer of the diagram.

**Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes: **
Ida Maria: Visual messiness could be considered for all types of diagrams and maybe it is not specific to Activity Diagrams.

**Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes: **
Ulno: Step by step describing the activities is already quite close to what the code should do. Are activity diagrams then needed? Also for non-technical people it would make more sense to just write things as stories instead of modelling them as activity diagrams.

**Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes: **
Ida Maria: The diagram is probably more understandable for non-technical people and is better for communicating the ideas and processes. Code is scary for the customer.
For some people stories might work better, but for some people having diagrams might be a better way of structuring the use cases. It depends on the person and context.

**Free discussion to find best points for and against: **
The group was not very confident that pro points selected were the best possible options, but we agreed that they were generally acceptable.
Activity diagrams can be used to extend use case diagrams by having a more detailed representation of the different paths, for example using conditionals to show different alternative scenarios.

**2 Best For:**

* Parallel behaviour and multi-threaded programming can be easily depicted.
* Helps with visualizing complex sequential algorithms. It has similar benefits as flowcharts.

**2 Best Against:**
* The activity diagrams are not usually object orientated. We can’t be sure how these activities map to specific objects and it would be difficult to use them for modelling objects.
* These diagrams are less useful for developers, because they are already quite close to the actual code when using object nodes, conditionals and parallel paths. Developers would probably prefer to write code instead.
