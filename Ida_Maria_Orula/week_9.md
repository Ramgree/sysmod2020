### Preparation for lecture on 03.11.2020

#### 1) Videos

This week I didn't put very much effort into finding specific pro and con arguments for the deployment diagrams, I just read about them from several sources to give myself an overview of them.

**Group 8 PRO:**

The main point I'll take home from this video is that the deployment diagrams are good when we need to show how the hardware and the software work together and if we need to address issues like scalability, performace tc.

**Group 4 CONTRA:**

The phrase that was most prominent in this video was "lack of" - lack of notation standards, lack of people using those standards etc. It makes the deployment diagrams feel messy and scary, but also nicely flexible and adaptable.

### Lecture tasks

#### Discussion - 3 things that each team leader does

* SCRUM master
1. Facilitates communication within the group
2. Keeps track of everyone's effort, makes sure everyone has enough tasks and is working on them
3. Organizes the working process (organizes and leads the meetings etc)

* Architecture owner
1. Creates diagrams and keeps them up to date
2. Helps team find answers to architectural questions/dilemmas
3. Makes sure that the diagrams and the actual code are following the same decisions

* Product owner
1. Decides on the final functionality of the system
2. Prioritizes functionalities and tasks for the developers
3. Discusses the architectural choices with the architecture owner and answers everyone's questions about functionality

#### Breakout

**Notes for Group Nr 4**

Moderator: Ida Maria Orula

Note-Taker: Benjamin CAMP

**Opening Notes:**

This is a discussion about deployment diagrams. Members of the group are: Benjamin C, Ida Maria Orula, Orkhan Jamaladdinov, Rain, Simo, Taavi Luik, Karl Vaba

**First Person Pro Notes:**

Okhan : A good overview of hardware devices, software artifacts, and their relationship in the development process. Additionally specifies external systems that need to be interacted with.

**Second Person Con Notes:**

Taavi : Lack of standards can lead to confusions.

**Third Person Pro Notes:**

Benjamin : Good to make architecture-related decisions

**Fourth Person Con Notes:**

Rain : Helping only a very specific group of people (devs & software architect), very technical

**Moderator Summary Notes:**

**Round 1 Person Challenge/Question Notes:**

Karl : If there is model-gap, the overview is biased

**Round 1 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes:**

Taavi: the deployment diagram gives a different aspect of the system, so there might be a gap (details are left out), but no conflict (details conflict with one another).

**Round 2 Person Challenge/Question Notes:**

Karl : Lack of standard is a double-edged sword : it also allow more freedom of modelling

**Round 2 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes:**

Ida : Depends on the scale of freedom took : the more you take, the shadier it might get. Within small groups it’s good if they can choose their own notation, but it might be a problem if they need to share their work with others.

**Round 3 Person Challenge/Question Notes:**

Ida Maria : A diagram being aimed to certain people is not necessarily a cons :they sometimes have to be technical enough to help his users

**Round 3 Person Comment/Defense/Answer Notes:**

Rain: I think this can be solved with a simple whiteboard communication. No diagram necessary.

Counterpoint: diagrams are made to remain and be used as references, but once you wipe the board..

**Free discussion to find best points for and against:**

Glorified class diagrams question:

Benjamin: deployment diagrams are too far from code to be considered a “glorified class diagram”.

Rain : “ They look like they are not useful during development for software devs”

Benjamin : “They are meant to act as a bridge between sysadmins and devs, to make communication easier”

Rain: “ But it is hard to express your ideas throught it”

Benjamin : “You can still express ideas throught a whiteboard presentation, diagram can be made after ! Diagram is made to remain, and be available for anyone that needs it.”

**2 Best For:**

Point 1: A good overview of hardware devices, software artifacts, and their relationship in the development process. Additionally specifies external systems that need to be interacted with.
Point 2: Good to make architecture-related decisions

**2 Best Against:**

Point 1: Lack of standards can lead to confusions.
Point 2: Helping only a very specific group of people (devs & software architect), very technical

#### Reflections about the lecture

**I once again took on the role of the moderator in the brakout room session and I also participated in the discussion with my own thoughts.** I enjoyed our discussion as it seemed that people were actually expressing and defending their own thought, rather than just cite what they had heard from the videos. I for example find it really interesting to discuss, whether the freedom that comes from lack of notation standards is a good or a bad thing. If there are no universal strict standards, then a small working group can work with whatever notation they feel most comfortable with and everything is well, BUT if they ever need to discuss their work with some other team who had also used their own notation, then it can be a nightmare as they just won't understand each other's diagrams. So where is the line between "yay, freedom!" and "yikes, too much freedom!"?

#### Reflections about the lab

The Miro board session was SCARY at first. We all needed to take some time to read the article about event storming and everyone was just quiet and the Miro board was empty. I was nervous and didn't have a clear idea of what we should do, but I knew that someone had to get the conversation going SOMEHOW. **So I took the initiative in trying to discuss what we should do and how.** At first it was just sentences like "Well, the article says we should list different events... hmm... can anyone think of any events? Okay... hmm... err... uhm.. From what I understand, we should write down the events and then organize them on a timeline.. Am I correct?" And so on. At first I was mostly talking alone but then other team members also became more active and we started to understand what we were doing. Or trying to do. Luckily Ulno also stepped in and helped us a bit. Afterwards things started to go rather smoothly. **I feel like I was still among the most active participants in this lab, as I was constantly asking questions and suggesting answers and new scenarios.** By the end of the lab I was quite happy with our results and felt like it would really be helpful for us in the future labs. We also agreed on tasks that we would do for next week. Our Miro board session can be seen [here:](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kgKpaq8=/)
