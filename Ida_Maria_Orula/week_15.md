### Lecture on 15.12.2020

**Teams 1, 11, 7**

It looks like a real professional commercial video. The extra feature is also interesting. The GUI is a bit too colorful for my liking. It definitely set the bar too high for the other videos though!

**Teams 2, 6, 8**

Nice clear GUI! I liked that the video covered many stories - this gives a good overview of the system. The robbery scenario was AMAZING! 

**Teams 3, 12**

The video was a bit hard to follow for me as it was slow and maybe too detailed. I think that a presentation video should just give and overall feel of the system, rather than all the tiny details.

**Teams 4, 9** 

The overview about the team management part was good.

**Teams 5, 10**

The puzzle extra feature was funny! It's a nice idea, but in reality I would hate it if I needed to do a quick transaction and my bank app forced me to solve a puzzle for it. The fairytale storyteller voiceover was also cool.

### Reflections

Everyone did a really nice job! I was also glad to hear that most teams encountered similar difficoulties like we did - it just goes to show that having problems and making errors is completely normal. In the end, I'm happy with how our system turned out. There was some last minute panic a few days before the final presentation deadline as I noticed that there had been some sort of a mess with the pages - some were missing and some were wrong. Luckily this didn't require any major changes. I just looked over all the relevant tasks, compared them to the work we had done and wrote down the inconsistencies I found. Then I shared this list with other team members and we fixed those errors. All is well that ends well and once again many thanks to my wonderful team and the always helpful and friendly instructors! It was a really nice course! I feel like I really learned something new and improved my skills in many different areas.
