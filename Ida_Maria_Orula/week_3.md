### Preparation task for lecture on 21.09

**1) Watch the movies.**<br>

Done! <br><br>

**2) Prepare 2 pro and 2 con arguments in advance for the movie topic(s). Bring one example where using this approach makes sense and one where it doesn't.**<br>

<ins>PRO:</ins><br>
-CDs are at a very reasonable level of abstraction - they can be used to simplify object diagrams that have become too messy, but also to discuss a very high level system
in more concrete details. <br>
-Can be mapped to code very easily - we define all necessary classes with the required attributes and how they all relate to each other.<br><br>

<ins>CON:</ins><br>
-Don't describe specific workflow well.<br>
-Inheritance hierrchy can get complicated.<br><br>

It makes sense to use CD when trying to give a general overview of the system and of the different classes it has. It doesn't make sense to use it for
understanding the detailed workflow.<br><br>

**3) While watching the movies of both parties note down in portfolio, what are main points I learned from the movie, what did I like/dislike.**<br>

* **Group 7: PRO** <br>
I loved the clear structure and calm descriptions. All given definitions where clear and the examples were easy to follow. I learned that class diagrams are used for
giving a static overview of a (part of a) system. As opposed to object diagrams, we don't draw out several specific instances but instead show relations with cardinalities.
Eg instead of adding an object for each wheel of a car we just create classes Car and Wheel and say there's a one-to-many relation between them.<br>
I also realised that I sligthly misunderstood the relation between class and object diagrams last week.
At first it made more sense to me that class diagrams come first, as they are more abstract and give the wider overview. And then based on them we can move to more specific examples
with object diagrams. But now that I think about it, it does actually make more sense for object diagrams to come first. It isn't easy to grasp the idea of the entire system
at first and it's a lot easier to bring small examples. Those examples (that can be described with ODs can then be transformed to CDs to get a more general overview of the program.
I still feel that maybe each approach could be valid, depnding on the situation...<br>
PS: The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" soundtrack was nice :) <br>


* **Group 12: PRO** <br>
Excellent explanations! Probably the most useful tip from the video was that using lower bounds in cardinalities can be tricky and might cause the program to crash if not implemented properly.
I also found the part about different types of relationships to be very useful.<br>

* **Groups 2 and 6: CONTRA** <br>
Well, this video seems to confirm the theory that I proposed above under the first video - depending on the situation object diagrams can be derived from class diagrams or vice versa...
Unless of course either of the groups misunderstood. This should probably be clarified, hopefully in the lecture. Relationships are explained well.<br>

### Tasks during the lecture on 15.09

#### 1) Why do we need software architectures /system models?
