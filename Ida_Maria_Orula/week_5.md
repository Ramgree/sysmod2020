### Preparation task for lecture on 06.10

**1) Watch the movies.**<br>

Done! <br><br>

**2) Prepare 2 pro and 2 con arguments in advance for the use case diagrams. Bring one example where using this approach makes sense and one where it doesn't.**<br>

<ins>PRO:</ins><br>
- They are created from the user's perspective and therefore help understand what expectations the users really have for the system.<br>
- Easily understood by both technical and non-tecnical people. two<br><br>

<ins>CON:</ins><br>
- Use cases are in free form so there's a lot of room for misunderstandings and different interpretations<br>
- They aren't object oriented. <br><br>

It makes sense to use use case diagrams if we want to show how a user interacts with the system. It wouldn't make sense to use them if we need to show many details about the system itself (eg what part needs some input from some other part etc)<br><br>

**3) While watching the movies of both parties note down in portfolio, what are main points I learned from the movie, what did I like/dislike.**<br>

* **Group 1: PRO** <br>
I liked the step by step instructions for creating a use case diagram. The Alan Cooper quote was also a nice addition. I think that the last part of the video, so the actual 
creation of a use case diagram, was a bit extensive. It is of course nice that they made such an example, but I don't think it was necessary to make it so long.<br>


* **Group 3: PRO** <br>
The background music made me sleepy, otherwise the video focused on some good points, such as those diagrams are intuitive enough that you can easily create them during a meeting with 
the stakeholders. Loved the "subscribe to my channel" part at the end - what kind of a youtube video ends without it?!<br>

* **Group 11: CONTRA** <br>
Amazing job on the video editing! The beginning felt like I was watching a trailer for some adventure movie. Some parts of the video were a bit hard to follow though. Some
 major points I remembered from the video were that use cases might have the problem of being inconsistent and that creating them can be time consuming since creating personas
 might require a lot of interviews and they're hard to create. Also, users might give insufficient or even incorrect information in the interviews.<br>
 
 * **Group 5: CONTRA** <br>
I liked that they started by explaining what a use case is, rather than jumping straight into the use case diagrams. I liked the explanation of personas - the US airforce example was interesting.
A good point was that it might be hard to find balance between too few and too many use cases.<br>

### Tasks during the lecture on 06.10

#### 1) Three groups pf people who most benefit from system modelling

- Customer/product owner - System modeling is a good way for the technical people actually developing the system to communicate with the customers. 
Without models, there might be miscommunication and the product might not meet the expectations of the customer.
If technical people only speak in technical terms and the customers only use their field's lingo, they might not understand each other by only talking.<br><br>

- The requirement engineer - He is the one responsible for deciding which functionalities are important in the system and how/what it should do. 
It’s easier if he can be sure that everyone is on the same page.<br><br>

- Initial developer - It can be hard to grasp the system at first so having a diagram to follow can be good.<br><br>

Of course it’s arguable. We could also say that the maintenance developer benefits even more than the initial one because he maybe wasn’t around since the beginning of development and has to understand it much later. 
Same for the tester. So I guess all people benefit from it, but the three I brought out seem most important to me. I think that users of the system can also benefit, but not so directly - if the modelling was done well and the system works, the user is happy, but if thats not the case then the user will probably have the choice to use some other system that meets his needs better.<br><br>


#### 2) Breakout room 6

My laptop was acting up and I couldn’t use my microphone for some reason. Strangely enough, I wasn't the only one. There were 3 people in our breakout room who had problems with their microphones.
That did make the conversation a bit trickier, because people don't always pay much attention to what is written in the chat. We still managed to have an interesting discussion
and cover many important arguments. I think **Karel Roots was an excellent moderator**! He always filled the awkward silences where no one knew what to say and made sure that all important points were covered.
For example, he brought it to our attention that we weren't focusing on personas enough, which lead to a discussion about how personas can be really useful to make sure we have
considered the needs of all the different users, but that they can also be really complicated to create. To create a credible persona you must be able to understand the needs of
that usergroup. To do it thoroughly, you could even need to make focus group interviews which is time consuming. It can be hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone else. 


### Reflections

This time I made the mistake of not writing my reflections down right after the lecture/lab, so I can't really remember much. I do remember that I liked the discussion about which people benefit from systems modeling the most, as it was interesting to try and see things from different people's viewpoints. I also realized that I still remembered some things about use cases and use case diagrams from some previous courses, but not in much detail. For example, I didn't know or didn't remember that actors and personas are not the same thing. It was nice to gain a new perspective on a topic that was already somewhat familiar.
