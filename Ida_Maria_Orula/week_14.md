#### Guest presentation

* What was most impressive, particular, insightful in Adam's history and current way of work?

I liked the point he made about mental models. So far we have mostly talked about modeling in the contexts of many different diagrams, but that is not all there is to it. Even just thinking the system through in your head can help. Although that isn't the best way for communicating your ideas to others. 

* One question regarding architectural or modeling elements in his work.

Just something I started to think about: we all know that clients tend to change their minds a lot and at the most unexpected times. This can be used as an argument both for and against thorough modeling. If we have really good models that we spent a lot of time on, then they should be detailed enough to describe the system to the client and the client can use this info to change what he wants to change before we even start writing code. But what if we have spend a lot of time and energy on the models, only for the client to simply change his mind or forget his initial wishes in the end? Then we will have used a lot of time both on code and the modeling. So where is the balance?

* What is Adam's opinion on No-code frameworks/development and do you share it or oppose it – why?

You must make sure the framework you use meets your needs. This seems like a reasonable view of it. For some problems a simple framework may be enough but if it isn't, then it's probably better to not use the framework, rather than trying to force it to work on your task.

* What is Adam's opinion on modeling and working with modeling in the university context, what role did this play for his future career? Do you share or oppose his opinion – why?

It is important to understand why good practices are considered good. I agree because we want to avoid just mindless coding - it is important to know why things are the way they are and how you can make this work to your benefit.

#### Lecture reflections

The presentation was interesting to listen.

#### Lab reflections

The deadline for the final presentation is near so it is a bit stressful, but everyone manages to stay calm and optimistic so that is good. I have been dividing my time between doing frontend tasks (designing pages and trying to help Rasul develop them in code), reading the chat to keep track of what everyone is doing and thinking and that all asked questions get answers, keeping an eye on the github issues to make sure we aren't missing anything important and that everything is done according to the issues, encouraging people to track their time and also trying to remember to track my own etc. We will have to work very fast and efficiently to get everything done during this last week, but I'm sure we'll manage.
