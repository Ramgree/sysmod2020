### Tasks from lecture on 01.12

* Singleton pattern problems

Testing and debugging can be hard as it can be changed at any part on the system.

* Working with Fulib

1

* Explain

It looks like it can be useful, but I'm not at all familiar with it and it just seemed complicated and boring.

* Which feature is exiting

Prototyping probably.. This is a necessary step in development if you need to discuss things with the client.

* Why am I not using Fulib

1. I prefer using frameworks I'm already familiar with until I find something that seems to be a lot better and intuitive enough to learn it quickly.
2. I haven't worked on huge projects so learning to use Fulib would just not be proportional to the benefit I'd get from it.

* What change would bake Fulib more attractive

* Would you like to work more with Fulib

Not in this course/not in the nearest future. I'm glad I know it exists, but I'd rather just learn to use it on my own whenever I need to.


### Reflection on the lecture

It was nice to see what Fulib is all about, but I don't think I'll use it myself anytime soon. But who knows. 

### Reflection on the lab
As usually, we had a brief 15 minute meeting in the beginning of the lab, where we gave an overview of what both teams have been doing and how everything is going. It seems to me that everything is going well enough. We might have to speed up our work a little bit, but I think we'll manage. **Lauri and Einar seem to have the most knowledge about everything so whenever there is a question, they'll usually know the answer to it.**

The teamwork in the frontend side is still not great as most of the time it's just me and Rasul working. At times this gets a bit frustrating because I also have my scrum master duties to fill. (On the other hand, getting things to work smoothly in this frontend team is a really good practice for my scrum master skills. I need to find ways to give really specific tasks and then be annoying about their deadlines. I might need that skill later in life.) Luckily **Rasul works very efficiently and quickly**, so in the end it works out fine: I figure out what elements the pages must have and create some wireframe-like thingies and he uses them to develop the pages in code. Today he also spent 30 minutes explaining his css and html code to me and by the end of the day I managed to develop a few pages myself. I know that css and html aren't actually that hard, but since I didn't understand much at the beginning, I'm really proud of myself for understanding it so much better now. And **thank you, Rasul, for explaining stuff to me!**

This have realized that this project has been a great learning opportunity for me in many aspects. I've seen improvement in both my IT and people skills. As a scrum master I must try to lead the meetings, make sure the communication within the team is efficient, remind people to track their time and close the issues for tasks that are done etc. All this requires initiating conversations and bugging people to do things, which is something I'm actually quite scared to do. It's really hard for me to go up to someone and say "Hey, you should actually be tracking your time" or "Hey, have you finished the task you were supposed to finish". But it's a necessary skill and I'm glad I'm learning it. 

After the first week I regretter having volunteered as the scrum master, but now I'm happy that I did. I don't know if I'm very good at it (only my teammates can say that) but I'm definitely not terrible so that's something! :D And **whenever the conversation stops during a meeting and I'm not completely sure how to continue or what to say next, Lauri usually takes the lead and keeps things moving. He's also always willing to think along when I have a question or an idea about the project. Thanks for that, Lauri!** 

I kind of feel like I should dedicate an entire paragraph to thanking my awesome teammates at some point! In case I forget to do this later on, I'll briefly do it now. I've already mentioned that Rasul works well and stays optimistic under less than ideal circumstances and always finishes his tasks on time. Also that Lauri is always willing to discuss things and really think about the best solutions. Taavi is very responsible with his architecture owner tasks and always asks if there's something he doesn't understand. Einar has a lot of technical knowledge and he's always happy to answer any questions the others have. Karl always completes his tasks as needed and participates in important discussions. And it will be thanks to Jekaterina that we'll have a nicely edited final presentation video in the end.
