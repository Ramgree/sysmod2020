### Lecture on 17.11.2020

#### Discussion

1. What about the model code gap? Will it be easier to hand-code business processes than modeling them and why or why not (try to give examples)?

Many developers would probably say that they'd rather just write the code and not spend time on modelling the system with diagrams. However, there are many different people who need to understand the systm that is being developed. The clients probably know nothing about programming languages but they need to be able to verify that the developers understand their needs correctly. So there needs to be like a translator between clients and developers. This translator is the one who can use diagrams and models to facilitate the progress. Models can also be used to give eg new developers a quick overview of the entire system before assigning them to a small part of it that they need to code.

2. Pick one of the most important application domains for BPM.

It's hard to pick one, it's important in any domain that has complex processes... Maybe

3. In which cases in this class, would BPM been feasible?

4. How would you think BPM relates to flow-charts, activity diagrams, and statecharts?

It has basically the same purpose: we need to model the process. It is kind of like a domain specific combined diagram that allows us to express many things together.

#### Lecture reflection

I was extremely tired in the lecture today and don't really have any reflections to write down. I did my best to follow along with what was being discussed. The visitor pattern seems really confusing for me and I don't understand the point of it. Maybe I'm just lookin past something obvious. I will read more about it after I hav gotten some sleep...

#### Lab reflection

First experience with having to bug people about completing their tasks and just overall participating in the work. Luckily I just needed to give brief reminder that we had agreed to write the concrete user stories. Most of the team had done it nicely, but some had forgotten it. Somehow there was even a person who didn't know what needed to be done even though we thoroughly discussed it last time... Oh the joys of being the scrum master...
The biggest task of today's lab was deciding on what technologies we want to use and who will focus on which tasks. **I decided to create a google doc to facilitate the decisionmaking and understand what everyone's skills and preferences were. I asked everyone to fill in whether they preferred to be on the front end or back end team and which programming languages they were most comfortable with. This approach was a sucess and we managed to make our decisions rather painlessly.** 
It turned out that our most experienced developers all preferred C# so this is the language that we chose. This meant that some team members had some catching up to do about it, but everyone agreed that this was ok. We ended up assigning 2 people to the backend team and 2 people to the frontend team. The team leaders also chose one team where they would help out with tasks if needed. I chose the frontend team.

We also decided that one voice chat meeting per week (during the lab) is not enough and agreed to have weekly voice chat meetings on Fridays as well. In addition to that, we agreed that frontend and backend team would have their own separate meetings to discuss most important things. 

The first frontend team meeting on the 19th was rather successful, even though there were some troubles with agreeing on the meeting time. I really hope this won't be a recurring issue. We decided that as the first step Jekaterina will create a wireframe, then I will help her improve it and the Rasul will implement it in html+css.
