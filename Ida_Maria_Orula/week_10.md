#### Discussion

* Examples of design patterns

Singleton, lazy initialization (yay I had knowingly used that one before!)

* Why do we need design patterns?

They're a good way to solve problems that occur often by just picking an existing design pattern solution, without having to come up with your own new solution from scratch.

#### Lecture reflection

For some reason the design patterns topic is really boring for me. I see why they're important and useful, but it's hard for me to focus when we're discussing them. I can't really even pinpoint why they have such effect on me... I guess in some cases it's just that using the apporach that is described by a design pattern seems so obvious and intuitive, that it just seems unnecessary to separately address it with the special name of a design pattern - it's just some obvious stuff that should be done here. This is definitely only true in some cases but I guess that's where my mind jumps to first.

#### Lab reflection

When we had to choose the team leaders, then everyone was just silent even though Ishaya had already told us several times that we really need to choose the leaders. **So I took the first step and volunteered to be the SCRUM master** even though this task seemed really scary and I had no idea if I'd be any good at it. I kind of regret this decision still because I feel really weird being the one leading the meetings and checking that people are working. But it is definiteley a really valuable experience so I'm also happy. I just hope I won't have a panic attack about it at some point! I am most afraid that I won't be able to tell how much work should be done by what time and then we'll fall behind on the schedule. But I think my team members will help me out in this department if needed. As of now, we are moving forward. Slowly, but we are moving. I made a google doc for the user stories and **also initiated the process of deriving the user stories from the Miro board**. We agreed to each choose 3 small stories (given only by 1 sentence at first) and develop proper concrete stories from them after the lab. I sure hope we are not spending too much time on design, but I feel like it's really important to get those decisions correct. Otherwise it would be like building a house without the foundation.
