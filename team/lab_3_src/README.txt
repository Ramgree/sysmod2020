This directory contains the source code (ATM.java, CardReader.java, Database.java, Keyboard.java, MoneyContainer.java, ScreenKeys.java) and test file (ATMTest.java) for the last assignment of Lab 3 (group 13) of the Systems Modelling course (MTAT.03.083) of University of Tartu.

The only dependency is junit. If you use IntelliJ IDEA, then you can just Alt+Enter on the junit import line in ATMTest.java, then read the popup to easily install it. 

To add these files to a project, just create a new simple Java project in IntelliJ IDEA (we used Java 1.8), copy the src folder to the project's folder, navigate to ATMTest.java in IntelliJ, then right click on the class name in "public class ATMTest {" line, click "Debug 'ATMTEst.java'" and the test should run.
