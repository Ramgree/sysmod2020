     * Scenario: Dave and Mary start a new game of Mancala. The 12 side pits are numbered 0 to 11, starting from the

     * and 1 (belonging to player 2).
     * Dave starts the game and picks up the stones in pit number 3, placing a pebble in pits 4, 5 and Mary's Kalah.
     * Mary picks up pebbles in pit number 6, placing pebbles in pits 7, 8 and 9.
     * Dave then picks up the pebbles in pit number 0, placing pebbles in pits 1, 2 and 3. Since pit number 3 is empty,
     * Dave picks up the 4 pebbles in pit 8 and places them to his Kalah, which will now contain 4 pebbles.
