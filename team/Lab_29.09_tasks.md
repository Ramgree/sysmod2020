### 5) Component Diagram Mancala Network Game
[1. High level view stressing the network connectivity and app running on a phone.](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SoWkIImgAStDuKhEpot8pqlDAr48JYqgIor24d0iA43Y1MG0QII-Rs9USc9E8XTNPbv9Qb5QOdAgWbzgINb-KJON5yGe1LrTk12K1Wg1ZGLY1JqzEwYXKAD08Z1NEAJcfG2T1m00) <br>
[2. Detail view of just the server part of the game.](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/JOv12i9034NtEKNelZs2TEkY8dY2qFv2SPf8Z1KHxswfeyvkvl7V8-qrnECs9r8RmDK9li2h9_KsNqoXmPreBqaASapoW9TW2fequAFquCuMx7KqUXMJ0-9kVYRwoDmqkrzvrRT_xbBUSbt_Mz_71hFNGeVrz3S0) <br>

We think these diagrams would be somewhat helpful to include if they already existed as they do help to quickly understand how the system works and what is planned for it. They definitely wouldn't hurt any requirements analysis document. However if one would start from scrach and the question would be if he should make the diagrams then it probably would be a waste of time as this system is simple enough to not really need any diagrams. <br>
