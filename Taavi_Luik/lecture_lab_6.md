### Preparation - Videos of Sequence Diagrams

#### Sequence Diagram Cons Group 14

Strongest points:
- Can be cumbersome and big with many objects.
- Close to the code level (low-level details take time to show)
- Will be outdated (if the diagrams come after the code, merely describe code, not be a basis *for* the code)
- Depend on appropriately named classes, objects, parameters

Lessons learned:
- SD-s are mostly used by developers.

It seems that the point regarding space inefficiency is more due to bad usage and not that much a problem of the diagram itself. But maybe I am biased since I did the pro video this week, haha.
A recurring con argument is that diagrams take time. This raises some important points to always consider - what is gotten out of this diagram and how long does it take to make it (a cost-benefit analysis); is it normative, i.e. used to design a system and hence will serve a bigger purpose or is just descriptive and merely mirrors an already existing system and will be outdated as soon as the system is changed? 
A diagram before the code implementation (intended to be a basis *for* the code) might last longer than a diagram that describes the code.

#### Sequence Diagram Cons Group 9

Strongest points:
- Cannot represent every condition; can only state basic facts
- Order of messages matter, notation can be complex and cause mistakes
- Takes horizontally much space
- Cannot be used for complete sequence/process description
- Prior syntactical knowledge is required to understand SD-s

Lessons learned:
- Maybe code + user story is better and simpler than a SD?

I liked the cons from this group.

#### Sequence Diagram Pros Group 13

This was our group.

Strongest points:
- SD-s complement other diagram types
- SD-s can be made more or less complex, depending on the needs and target audience
- SD-s are good for design meetings
- SD-s can be used to coordinate between teams if each team works on their own component.
- SD-s have the ability to represent the passage of time

Should have started earlier with my contribution so I would have finished earlier, giving more time for editing. We didn't (well, I didn't) coordinate that well so some info was duplicated, but at the same time it doesn't hurt to listen some things multiple times.
