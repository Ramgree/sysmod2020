# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 10 (10.11.2020)

### Discussion

**Examples of design patterns:**
- adapter, object pool, lazy initialization, singleton

**Why do we need design patterns?**
- They allow developers to talk about design using the same language and also to find a solution to a problem from relatively simple tools from a 'toolbox' of design patterns, without having to start from scratch and create your own. 

Design patterns are also relatively simple and small, atomic. As a result, one can create software consisting of separate parts that can be changed at will, without incurring changes in other unrelated parts. This might not happen with spaghetti code.

### Lecture reflections

I like that we are talking about design patterns. This seems like a huge part of good systems modelling - using a set of common (and good) tools for common problems. This accelerates development, but also helps with communication.

### Lab reflections

We continued our work, but I'm slightly afraid we're not moving on fast enough. Then again, this design phase *is* difficult and we're probably all in somewhat new territories. And this stage cannot be rushed too much either, early design decisions can save or waste a lot of time later.
