### Preparation

#### Class diagrams pros video, Group 12

I wish the first video would have had examples of dependency, association, aggregation etc with actual examples, not with the College-Student pair.

Strongest points:
- Class diagrams are simple to create (with the right software)
- Class diagrams give a detailed view of the system

Lessons learned:
- relationships in a class diagram include dependencies, inheritance and associations, not merely associations.  


#### Class diagrams pros video, Group 7

Strongest points:
- Class diagrams can be used to create classes in code (with the right tools) and vice-versa.
- Class diagrams are concise and expressive.

Lessons learned:
- Class diagrams can be considered when Object diagrams have become too messy

I liked the inheritance vs composition discussion. I've learned about the usefulenss of providing interfaces in game design. E.g. in the Unity engine, components are used to provide functionality to objects. This provides much more flexibility.
I also liked that concrete tools were introduced that enable automated class diagram creation.

####  Class Diagrams cons, Group 6&2

Strongest points:
- Class diagrams might create unnecessary complexity if not done well
- Class diagrams have some difficult yet important aspects (e.g. distances between classes)

Lessons learned:
- Differences between aggregation and composition. 
- When creating diagrams, one has to think about the recipients and tailor the diagram accordingly.

It was slightly hard to find which diagram relationship was discussed since they were all on the same slide and the order of discussion was random.

----

My own pros:
- A class diagram can give a good overview for the developers themselves, if the diagram is automatically created and the domain is not too complex.

My own cons:
- A small point, but still relevant: in some complex domains (e.g genetics) a class diagram might be too abstract and not be useful enough to assess if the architecture covers all edge cases - an object diagram (with concrete data) or something else might be also required.
