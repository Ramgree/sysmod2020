# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 4 (29.09.2020)

### Preparation

#### Our own video: Component Diagrams Cons, Group 13

Strongest points:
- Component diagrams are hard to do well
- Component diagrams are in-between an abstract model and the real implementation, giving the benefits of neither. 
- It's impossible to show unmet requirements

Lessons learned:
- If you learn the meanings of elements and have a goal in mind, then component diagrams can work and be useful, even if they are hard to make.

#### Component Diagrams Pros, Group 4

Strongest points:
- Can get a bird's eye view of the most important systems and how they relate to one-another
- They are not programming language specific

The examples in the video were nice.

#### Component Diagrams Pros, Group 14

Strongest points:
- Component diagrams show the main parts of the system
- Component diagrams simplify the high level view

I liked the idea of having a 5-step-program to create a component diagram.

#### Component Diagrams Cons, Group 12

Strongest points:
- Component diagrams can be hard to maintain in dynamic systems - i.e. systems where more interfaces/components/dependencies will be added in the future.

I think that a diagarm does not show all the implementations of an interface and hence the diagram does not have to get cluttered.

----

Since I was also recording for this week, I'll reiterate the points I made in the video:

- Various elements in a component diagram can be expressed in multiple ways, which might lead to confusion unless we are consistent with their usage.

- Component diagrams should not be very big and complex, which means that we might end up with many component diagrams, each of which will not be that informative.

- Component diagrams are hard to make well - one has to choose which details to omit and which to show.
