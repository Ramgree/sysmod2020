### Preparation - Videos of Use Case Diagrams

#### System Modeling Use Case Diagram Pros, Group 1

Strongest points:
- Use Case diagrams allow to analyze the system from the perspective of the end user, hence focus on the functionality.
- They help us to see alternative ways how to achieve a good system.
- They are (or: can be) easy to understand by non-technical people (helps with communication).

Lessons learned:
- Personas and actors are different things

The tutorial on how to create a use case diagram was a good idea, but perhaps could have been shorter. I think that using the 'include' and 'extend' nomenclature to talk about dependent and independent events is very confusing. Can a use case diagram not use the words 'dependent' instead?
If I would be a non-technical person, I would immediately ask why the Withdraw money function 'extends' the Print receipt function. It was also unclear how use case diagrams are good for analytics.

#### System Modeling Use Case Diagram Cons and Pros, Group 11

Strongest Cons:
- They scatter features and objects
- Potential for inconsistency and confusion
- Cannot be used for testing (because requirements cannot be specified well enough)
- A good use case diagram takes time because of interviews
- They can be hard to understand for developers and lead to misunderstandings
- It's difficult to create personas - based on which property? How to make sure that big groups of users are not left out?

Strongest Pros:
- They model system requirements
- Easy to understand

Lessons learned:
- A persona is more than a user, e.g. a certain demographic stereotype that helps answer some design questions for many people at the same time.

Some parts were hard to follow due to the amount of information and speed of presentation. A point was given, but not always followed up, clarified, explained, how exactly this is a problem.

#### System Modeling User Story Diagram Pros, Group 3 

Strongest points:
- Easy to use, can be created with stakeholders
- Can help decide what aspects of a system to test (acceptance testing, high level)
- Can help list the features of a system - the main use cases are the main features.
- Can help lead to good UX - they show actual functionality that is required and UX can be tailored to that.

Lessons learned:
- User Story diagrams are like the text versions of Use Case diagrams.

Music was slightly loud during some quiet presenters. 

#### System Modeling Use Case Diagrams & Personas, Group 5

Strongest points:
- Persona modelling can sometimes overcome bad stakeholder analysis
- In-depth interviews are expensive and time-consuming; many personas are required 
- Focusing on function leaves out non-functional aspects (which are also important)
- The logic in the diagram is linear and simplified, but in reality there are loops, conditions etc.
- Hard to do well (where to draw the line regarding how many use cases to include?)
- Objects and classes are scattered over multiple use cases

Lessons learned:
- A persona might become too average. They should be based on research, not just made up.
- Personas are detailed (motivations, habits etc are specified)
