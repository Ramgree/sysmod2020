# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 14 (08.12.2020)

### Discussion

**My picks for top 2 design patterns:**
- Iterator: very simple to understand, used in many places (seen it a lot in Java). Makes sense to use it as well.
- Adapter: again, same point - very simple to understand and can be used in many places, where a component's output or input needs to be 'translated' to be compatible with existing components.

**Presentation by Adam**

- What was most impressive, particular, insightful in Adam's history and current way of work?
	- When he first mentioned a project that failed, I was expecting some moderately hard to find architecture choices, but was surprised how bad that project really was. Even I could see why that will probably not work. I liked this idea of software-based projects, where you can just take whatever you need from a cloud service provider (under a budget of course). Iteration cycles matter a lot - if they are small, then you can get feedback sooner and move on if things work (or don't work). Another important point is ecosystem and modularity - if there is a big ecosystem and you write modular code, you can reuse existing parts (created either by you or someone else).
	- Another interesting point was that a mental model is better than any model, and your model does not need to be expressed in diagrams or in UML necessarily. Modelling matters, UML is just a tool for an end goal.
- One question regarding architectural or modeling elements in his work.
	- How to think about 'good enough' design and avoid sinking too much time in the design phase? I guess in workflows that have existed for a long time are already solidified and not much will change. But I often think about potential situations where a project might move later and want to make things flexible, but tend to spend too much time on such analysis. Are these general concepts such as modularity good enough when followed properly? Nobody can see all possible developments and if clients do a 180 degree turn, then the developer is not to blame as well, of course. Clients rarely know fully what exactly they need (now or a year later). 
- What is Adam's opinion on No-code frameworks/development and do you share it or oppose it – why?
	- Your problem that you are trying to solves really has to match what the framework offers. I completely agree: if it works it can be great, but if you have to find workarounds to limitations and it becomes messy, it is a bad fit.
- What is Adam's opinion on modeling and working with modeling in the university context, what role did this play for his future career? Do you share or oppose his opinion – why?
	- Learning what are considered 'good practices' and more importantly, WHY and WHERE they are considered good, is really important. If they are ignored, we get projects like Adam talked about in the beginning. I agree - most good practices are not considered good because of trivial reasons, knowing them helps, but of course one should not be too strict in following these practices. Following for the sake of following them is also bad.
  
### Lecture reflections
  
Adam's presentation was very useful and insightful. I think I reflected quite well under the previous section, so I won't repeat myself. 
  
### Lab reflections, time spent on project

- 08.12: 0.75h - meeting and discussion
- 11.12: 1.75h - meeting, went over code and updated the class model. Planned video - what to show and say.
- 12.12: 3h - updated models, prepared diagrams for video.
- 13.12: 2.5h - went over diagrams, did my part of the video.

The last sprint was a bit stressful, since I thought we have to prepare the video much earlier and everyone else seemed so relaxed, so I just went along with it. In the end it worked out, so it's fiiiiine.
So much was learned over this course, even if there was a bit too much work at times.
