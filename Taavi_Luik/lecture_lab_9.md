### Preparation - Videos of Diagrams

#### Deployment Diagrams Pros by group 8

Strongest points:
- Useful for making decisions related to architecture (scalability, performance, portability, maintainability).
- Gives a good overview of hardware devices, software artifacts (in addition to external systems) and their relationships in the deployment process.

Lessons learned:
- Deployment diagrams show how hardware and software work together
- This is a diagram type that is least understandable and relevant for me since I don't have that much software engineering experience (esp when it comes to deployment). But I can see its uses, it's definitely a diagarm that can be useful in many contexts where actual deployment of software is done and needs to be planned.

#### Deployment Diagrams Cons by group 4

Strongest points:
- Lack of standards for visual notation
- Lack of notation for cloud environments
- Mixed abstraction levels

Lessons learned:
- Lack of syntax rules (or lack of people following them) can cause frustration if notation is really different between diagrams. So some well-chosen and agreed upon notation can be important.

The mixed abstraction levels con argument can also be a pro argument. Flexibility allows the designer to choose whether to do something or not and sometimes this flexibility allows us to add details that are really useful to communicate something.

----

Martin Fowler (in UML Distilled) writes that there's not much to say about them, but this doesn't mean that these diagrams shouldn't be used. They are useful for any nontrivial deployment. 

So far I've always had to deal with trivial deployment, hence it's slightly difficult to imagine myself using these diagrams (especially if I don't plan on working in software development in the near future). But it's good to know what notation is used so the next time I see one, I am better prepared to read them.
