# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 15 (15.12.2020)

### Discussion
**What do I like about movies/presentations?**

- team1_11_7: “Seven Eleven” https://youtu.be/UuOBxSeeOd4
  - Quite high quality presentation. We had something much more simple.
  - Gamble feature was funny!

- team2_6_8: “Awesome Bank” https://youtu.be/kGAbrQs785Y
  - Very clean UI
  - Props for having transaction modification, we opted just for cancellation since it was easier. 
  - Also funny team role presentation

  - Interesting that the admin literally uses a console to interact with the app. Others (including us) opted for a GUI console.
  - Distinguishing feature not that distinguishing? Ok, later found out that the user can also cancel transactions.

  - Cool that you're supporting multiple accounts per user. Account number is *very* long though, hard to keep track if you cannot copy-paste. 
  - Spending limit is a cool idea - actually useful, not just for fun.
  - Subgroups are also a good idea. 
  - Very thorough and useful project management problems (with solutions!)

- team5_10: https://drive.google.com/file/d/137RG7dLKAAwJvgaXCH7Mzyre_uQkVewI/view
  - Live-action acting to go with the demo? Cool :D
  - Puzzles as distinguishing feature? Awesome idea

- team13_14: https://youtu.be/PITPZzd5-gE
  - Our group. It was haaard to learn ASP.NET so quickly
  - Very relaxing music for the last lecture.

### Lecture reflections
Overall it seems other teams also had difficulties yet managed to produce a working bank system - good job everyone!

The first video set the bar quite high, so well done there.
