### Lecture 7
#### Prep
**State charts**
**Pros:**
* State charts can make understanding difficult processes easier if they are done well.
* State charts apparently lead to less bugs.<br>

**Cons:**
* Easy to miss a transition
* In bigger sytems with many states can easily become a mess<br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when defining requirements. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use . <br>

**Group 9: State charts Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what are state charts, difference between state charts and state machines, what's a state, what's a finite-state machine, different state charts, how to draw one.<br>

Strongest point: Leads to to less bugs

**Group 11: State charts Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: Some history, what are state charts, different terms and how a state chart works, difference between state charts and state machines.<br>

Strongest point: it's a dynamic model

**Group 7: State charts Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what's a finite state machine, why state charts are better, what are state charts, some syntax, when to use state charts.<br>

Strongest point: Learning curve is steep

**Group 10: State charts Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are state mahchines, reactive sytems and state charts, purposes of state chart diagrams and their notation<br>

Strongest point: complexity rises fast when sytem gets bigger
