### Lecture 13
#### Tasks
** Singleton pattern **
Do you see any problems, risks, or annoyances in using this pattern? Why is it controversial? <br>
It's difficult to debug as anything in the system can at any time change the object. <br>
<br>
Find 1 example for our bank case<br>
It could be used to represent the logged in user.<br>
<br>

** Fulib **
How did you like working with Fulib in beginning of this class (1 not at all â€“ 5 very much).<br>
3<br>
<br>
Explain your choice (why/what did you like, what did you dislike and why).<br>
It seems like a good and useful tool but it didn't feel very intuitive but i guess there's a limit to how intuitive it can be when
 trying to "draw" diagrams with code.<br>
<br>
<br>
Which feature looks exciting for you to revisit using Fulib in a software modeling environment?<br>
i guess protoryping.<br>
<br>
Write down one example where the use of Fulib would have simplified your work with your current final project.<br>
With how our work is set up i don't think Fulib would have been that useful to us in this project.<br>
<br>
What are your two main reasons why you are not using Fulib anymore or would not use it again?<br>
Currently I just don't need to do much modeling and the few models i do need to do can be easily done by hand. But if i was working
on something that needed more modelling then i would consider using Fulib.<br>
<br>
Write down at least one point that you would like to see change to make Fulib more attractive for (students in) systems modeling?<br>
Make the code more intuitive and improve the documentation maybe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you have liked to do more work with Fulib to explore based on what you have seen right now?<br>
In general i don't have anything against working with Fulib more but for this course i don't think it's necessary.<br>
<br>

#### Lecture reflection
While Fulib is probably a good tool I don't think this was a very useful lecture. You already introduced us to Fulib so those interested could
follow up on it but i think Fulib isn't that ready for general advertisement and I feel like i didn't learn much in this lecture.
