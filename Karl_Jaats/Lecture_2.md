### Lecture 2
#### Prep
**Object Diagrams**
**Pros:**
* Really close to implementation so it's easy to implement
* Can be used to really understand how the system works in practice <br>

**Cons:**
* Can only be used for a small system/part of system, otherwise it gets really big and hard to grasp
* Not applicable to not object oriented solutions <br>

**Example 1:** When trying to reverse engineer a program it makes sense to make a object diagram of it to understand whats happening better <br>
**Example 2:** When trying to structure a big project it doesn't make sense to use object diagrams as they are too 'zoomed in' <br>

#### Tasks
I was in breakout C. <br>
My main points were that object diagrams don't work with non object oriented solutions like functional programming and that they are easy to implement as the programmers doesn't really have to really invent anything themselves. <br>
The outcome for the breakout was that we found that the best points for and against object diagrams are: <br>
2 Best For: <br>
ODs are easy to implement. <br>
ODs are concrete and extremely easy to read and understand.  <br>
2 Best Against: <br>
ODs are hardly doable for large systems. <br>
ODs wonâ€™t work for non-object oriented solutions. <br>

#### Lecture reflection
It was good. Much better than the first one, the recorded/live hybrid seems to work really well. I'm still not sure about the breakouts into random groups because as an introvert I find that sort of situations difficult to engage in but I guess I'll manage. For that reason they also lose a bunch of time before they get going because people feel awkward and nobody wants to take charge.

#### Lab reflection
Again kinda tedious exercises with not a lot of learning per time investment though i guess it wasn't too bad. We do have to actually draw some of the diagrams we talk about to make it stick better and be more understandable.

#### Tasks from the lab
Can be found [here](/team/Lab_1509_tasks.md). I did the diagrams for 2.1.3.
