### Lecture 8
#### Prep
**Activity diagrams**
**Pros:**
* Good for finding use cases and their pre- and postconditions
* Easy to understand<br>

**Cons:**
* Complex brancing is difficult to show in a easily readable way
* Often unneccesary<br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when figuring out use cases especially when when they are complex and overlap. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use if the questions it answers, like what can be done in parallel, are clear already. <br>

**Group 6+2: Activity diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what are activity diagrams, what are they used for, the notation, how to generate code from the diagrams<br>

Strongest point: Can model parallel and multithreaded programs well

**Group 8: Activity diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are activity diagrams, some notation, <br>

Strongest point: As they are not always object oriented then it might be difficult to translate it to code

**Event Storming**
In which contexts does Alberto use the term model or modeling during this presentation?<br>
Modeling space being unlimited in big picture workshop and the scope of the model there is the entire buisness.<br>
Modeling everything that happens in the flow with domain events.<br>
Different people care about different things so they need different models.<br>
Process modeling, so modeling how the problem spot operates.<br>
Read model - information needed for a given user for a given decision.<br>
<br>
How does Event Storming relate to the UML?<br>
Helps to understand what if going on and so helps to choose what uml models to use and what to put in them.<br>
<br>
What is the goal of Event Storming in terms of software development and understanding?<br>
To make the 'understanding what needs to be written' part of software development faster.<br>
<br>
What does Bruce Lee have to do with all this?<br>
After doing the event stroming you will be confident like Bruce Lee and inviting more requirements, more complexity.<br>
<br>
In which context does Alberto mention State Charts or State Machines?<br>
When investigating aggregates we focus on state machines among other things.

#### Lecture reflection
It is definitely true that UML is kinda hard to learn and often tedious and so 
people tend to be reluctant to use it. So finding something to replace it would definitely be good.
I think DDD and Event Storming do help a bit with it but i think it's not enough really, i think the modeling world might need 
a bit more radical and complete reformation to really improve. At least thet's the feeling i get.<br><br>

The demonstration of Event Storming and Miro was definitely useful and helpful but again i feel like something a bit more fully
planned with less pauses and the err..s and umm..s that come from live thinking would maybe be a bit better. But maybe doing it live
like that is actually more informative, i don't know.
