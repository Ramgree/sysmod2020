### Lecture 8
#### Prep
**Activity diagrams**
**Pros:**
* Good for finding use cases and their pre- and postconditions
* Easy to understand<br>

**Cons:**
* Complex brancing is difficult to show in a easily readable way
* Often unneccesary<br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when figuring out use cases especially when when they are complex and overlap. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use if the questions it answers, like what can be done in parallel, are clear already. <br>

**Group 6+2: Activity diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what are activity diagrams, what are they used for, the notation, how to generate code from the diagrams<br>

Strongest point: Can model parallel and multithreaded programs well

**Group 8: Activity diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are activity diagrams, some notation, <br>

Strongest point: As they are not always object oriented then it might be difficult to translate it to code

**Event Storming**
In which contexts does Alberto use the term model or modeling during this presentation?<br>
Modeling space being unlimited in big picture workshop and the scope of the model there is the entire buisness.<br>
Modeling everything that happens in the flow with domain events.<br>
Different people care about different things so they need different models.<br>
Process modeling, so modeling how the problem spot operates.<br>
Read model - information needed for a given user for a given decision.<br>
<br>
How does Event Storming relate to the UML?<br>
Helps to understand what if going on and so helps to choose what uml models to use and what to put in them.<br>
<br>
What is the goal of Event Storming in terms of software development and understanding?<br>
To make the 'understanding what needs to be written' part of software development faster.<br>
<br>
What does Bruce Lee have to do with all this?<br>
After doing the event stroming you will be confident like Bruce Lee and inviting more requirements, more complexity.<br>
<br>
In which context does Alberto mention State Charts or State Machines?<br>
When investigating aggregates we focus on state machines among other things.
