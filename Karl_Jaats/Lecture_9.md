### Lecture 9
#### Prep
**Deployment Diagrams**
**Pros:**
* Gives an overview of what hardware devices and software artifacts are there and how they fit together.
* Simple way to see what external systems are involved.<br>

**Cons:**
* Abstraction levels of different components are different.
* No set way to show cloud applications.<br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when trying to write down all the different external systems that the system will need to interact with.<br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use when the system is small and doesn't have many artifacts or external systems it works with.<br>

**Group 8: Deployment Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what id deployment diagram, the structure and notation, what to consider when creating one.

Strongest point: There is no model-code gap.

**Group 4: Deployment Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What deployment diagrams are used for, notation.

Strongest point: There is no way to show security.

#### Tasks
Example of what could be a task for them in the final project:<br>
Product owner:<br>
Final decision on what should be on the backlog or not<br><br>

Scrum master:<br>
Ensuring everybody are doing their jobs.<br><br>

Architecture owner:<br>
Decides what diagrams should be made

#### Lecture reflection
Fairly organisational lecture today as the project was being introduced. I think the project is probably fine and doable and probably pretty
interesting and informative. I do kinda doubt a little if the assigned roles in the teams are going to work at all like they would in a
"real" project as the team dynamic will work a little differently in a uni project compared to a professional one as everybody is really
pretty much in the same position. But that's not necessarily a bad thing as it is all good experience in how people work together and
still good experience for acting in these roles for the first time. 

#### Lab reflection
Did the Event Storming today. The initial team role assignment had the problem that people weren't very enthusiasticly volunteering but we got 
everything got assigned in the end anyway. The start of event storming was also pretty rocky as nobody wanted to really talk and we didn't really
have a very good idea of how to start or how to actually do event storming but after ulno helped us get started everything went pretty smoothly
even though there still wasn't much talking but it turned out that at least in a fairly simple system like that it's not necessary. <br>
The event storming really is a pretty quick and good way to get an initial overview of what the system needs to be and what it needs to do
and also gives an idea of the flow of the program. So a good practice that i think would be good to use in real projects going forward.
