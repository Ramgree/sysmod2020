### Lecture 6
#### Prep
**Sequence diagrams**
We made one of the pro videos for this week. <br>

**Pros:**
* Helps to coordinate between teams that work on components of the system that are going to need to interact.
* Complements other diagrams as it fills its specific purpose.<br>

**Cons:**
* Conditional interactions are hard to model.
* Modeling a multithreaded system might be difficult/messy. <br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when designing the system as it shows how the system will work/fit together. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use if the system being developed relies heavily on multithreading as a core part of it. <br>

**Group 10: Sequence Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are sequence diagrams, what are its purposes, its notation<br>

Strongest point: Can be used for testing

**Group 9: Sequence Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are sequence diagrams, how are they categorised, what sort of messages are there in sequence diagram and how are they drawn<br>

Strongest point: A snapshot between two timeframes not a complete view of the system.

**Group 14: Sequence Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What are sequence diagrams, its notation<br>

Strongest point: Being close to code means it's time consuming to make and maintain


#### Tasks
What are some other things we can do to communicate with the customer?<br>
Prototypes are good thing to do as they are comparatevly quick and easy to make and easy for the customer to give feedback on
and see what the system would actually look like. Might make the customer realize some things about what they want they didn't think
of when imagining the system.<br><br>

What are the disadvantages of doing mockups in hardware compared to on paper?<br>
On paper it can be less formal and so can be done fast and loose. Also it is easier to start on paper as you don't need to install or learn
another program.

#### Lecture reflection
In terms of the paper vs hardware mockups I personally prefer hardware ones exept in cases when i want to draw up something extreamly
quick to illustrate something during a conversation. Paper is good for quick temporary stuff but when you want to modify or adjust
or play around with the mockup paper becomes real hard to work with and becomes either tedious or really messy.<br><br>

The first half of the lecture was good, gave a good explanation/demonstration of mockups.<br><br>

I still don't like the break-up system. I guess particularily I don't enjoy participating in them. If the lessons took place in class and
I would meet these people in person I wouldn't have any problem with it but over the internet getting the dynamic going is a real problem.
Talking is kind of a chore anyway and the way these break-ups generally work out is that a couple of people say the pros or cons they
wrote up in the prep for the class and they are written down. No real discussion takes place. The bare minimum is done and no group dynamic
exists because over the internet it's a lot more awkward. It ends up being a chore that doesn't really have much benefit.<br><br>

The PySimpleGUI demonstration worked fine I guess but as we use JavaFX for our GUI it didn't really have much use for us. And as I 
said in some previous week I think the code explanations might be more smooth if the code is already written beforehand but i guess there is
the problem that it might become too quick and hard to follow like that.


#### Lab reflection
Pretty lengthy tasks again this lab but since we have been given an extension it is much more reasonable. Man I never have much to say
about the labs.
