### Lecture 5
#### Prep
**Sequence diagrams**
We made one of the pro videos for this week. <br>

**Pros:**
* Helps to coordinate between teams that work on components of the system that are going to need to interact.
* Complements other diagrams as it fills its specific purpose.<br>

**Cons:**
* Conditional interactions are hard to model.
* Modeling a multithreaded system might be difficult/messy. <br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use when designing the system as it shows how the system will work/fit together. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use if the system being developed relies heavily on multithreading as a core part of it. <br>

**Group 10: Sequence Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are sequence diagrams, what are its purposes, its notation<br>

Strongest point: Can be used for testing

**Group 9: Sequence Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are sequence diagrams, how are they categorised, what sort of messages are there in sequence diagram and how are they drawn<br>

Strongest point: A snapshot between two timeframes not a complete view of the system.

**Group 14: Sequence Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What are sequence diagrams, its notation<br>

Strongest point: Being close to code means it's time consuming to make and maintain
