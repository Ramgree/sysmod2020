# Systems modeling
## Karl Jääts

### Lecture 1
#### Preparation
Which types of diagrams are mentioned in the talk? <br>
Layered, UML, homeless c#, all kinds of non standard diagrams that people who don't know what they're doing have made <br>
<br>
What is the standard for modeling software mentioned in the movie? <br>
UML <br>
<br>
Why is nobody using it? <br>
Too complex, too low level, people don’t know it, they think agile and tdd is a replacement, because they make peoples heads hurt so they avoid them, no zoom in/out option <br>
<br>
What is the model-code gap and what is the problem with it? <br>
That the model shows different things than the code and you view them differently. The problem is that if the model and the code dont match then it is pointless to have the model. <br>
<br>
What do you personally think about layers for modeling software? <br>
The big, zoomed out, abstract layers I intuitively don't like, I find them to be difficult to understand and think they convey little actual information and thus are largely pointless/for show. The smaller, more zoomed in, implementation layers are necessary and a bit different. That being said I don't really have much experience with layers and software models so my opinion is very much subject to change. <br>
<br>
How do you think about Systems Modeling after watching this movie? <br>
A struggle and a necessary thing nobody really wants to do. <br>
<br>
Anything else remarkable from the movie, we should share/discuss? <br>
That modeling should involve more thinking on your own and not blindly following standards. <br>

#### Lecture questions
What do you expect from Systems modeling? <br>
To understand systems modeling and make me a more well rounded developer. <br>
<br>
Architectures/modeling techniques I've already worked on? <br>
UML a bit, not much else. <br>
<br>
Who am i, why studing in SE masters? <br>
Estonian, liked programming in high school, studied it in bachleors and SE seemed like the direction to go, mainly because i wasn't very good/knowladeable about it while it seems like a crucial aspect of software development. <br>
<br>
What are my software development skills? <br>
Mainly programming (primarily java and python but a bunch of other stuff too), all kinds of bits and bobs i half remember from the bachleors degree. <br>
<br>
What are my weaknesses regarding software development? <br>
Formal planning and kinda the whole SE part of it. <br>
<br>
Software achitecture: <br>
Architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution. [IEEE 1471] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/feb06/eeles/index.html) <br>

#### Lecture reflection
First lecture in the new confusing situation so there was some trial and error, some stuff worked, some not much. In general there seemed to be a fair bit of jumping between different topics with a bunch of exercises mixed in which made it really hard to follow for me. I don't think I really learned much during it and think it should be taken a little more calmly, a little more traditionally. But in general that sort of style of lectures can work I think, it just needs a bit more refinement/adjustment. Plus this being the first lecture it was more of an admin lecture about the course and I think I kinda understand how the course will work, so the aims were mostly fulfilled so maybe I'm being a little hasty in my judgement.

#### Lab reflection
A very administrative lab so there's not much to say. Some of the lab exercises were pretty annoying and the learning aspect in them seemed pretty low.
