### Lecture 11
#### Tasks

**BPM discussion** <br>
Pick one of the most important application domains for BPM. <br>
Big companies, especially ones dealing with complex systems, like logistics companies. <br> <br>

In which cases in this class, would BPM been feasible? <br>
Maybe to use with event storming? Or do it using the results from event storming. (wrote it down before ulno spoke about it) <br><br>

How would you think BPM relates to flow-charts, activity diagrams, and statecharts? <br>
Pretty similar thing with very slight differences to make it more suitable for modeling business processes. <br> <br>

What about the model code gap? Will it be easier to hand-code business processes than modeling them and why or why not (try to give examples)? <br>
BPM is more usage oriented and easily understandable so might be a little easier in that sense but as it's not talking about implementation code 
it might need some extra diagrams that are closer to code like class diagrams before actual implementation. <br> <br>

**Visitor discussion** <br>

Which problems or annoyances in using this pattern do you see? <br>
Potentially could be hard to manage for example if something needs to be changed in the base class. Also at least for me its hard to visualize 
it/intuitively grasp it.<br>

<br>
Find 1 example for our bank project. <br>
Maybe for the user so the operations could be added to it separately<br>

<br>
What did you think about the example(why do you like/dislike it)? <br>
I think it would be better to not include the "evil" element and instead do it as it is supposed to be done.<br>


#### Lecture reflection
Business process modeling is an interesting thing and it's kinda funny how closely it resembles event storming in some aspects. Which in a way
shows that either we are talking about real cutting edge stuff that hasn't had time to really coalesce into more uniform ways of doing things or
that parts of the industry are not really talking to each other.

#### The Project
It's definitely more difficult to work in a team of 7 compared to a team of 4. We are having some problems getting the development going at a 
reasonable pace. <br>
We picked the technology stack this week. We decided on C# web development framework asp.net which 
some of us have a bunch of experience with but I don't know it. Personally not sure if the choice was 
a good one. <br>
What I did: As I'm not familiar with the asp.net framework i had to first start learning about it, which took a lot longer than I thought it would 
and I still feel like i don't really understand it. Managed to mostly complete a backend task for the project after
struggling with it for several hours. If i were comfortable with the framework it would probably not have taken me more than 15 minutes, which is 
frustrating as i don't feel like I've contributed much value to the project so far. But what can I do, it just takes time to learn it. <br>
<br>
On a more general note I'm not sure if this project really fits this course very well. It's a
lot of work and time put into programming with seemingly a pretty big emphasis on more general
project managment/ Agile practices. The course is called Systems Modeling though and the big teams and bigish project mean that very few of us
are actually dealing with the modelling part of the project. The experience with programming in a little bigger team than what the usual uni ones are 
is useful but I feel like that should maybe be part of some other course.
