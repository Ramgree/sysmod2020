### Lecture 12
#### Tasks
**Observer pattern** <br>
Which problems or annoyances in using this pattern do you see?<br>
Can be difficult to debug.<br>
<br>
Find 1 example for our bank usecase.<br>
For logging events.<br>
<br>
Find 1 example outside of the bank usecase.<br>
For buttons in user interfaces.<br>
<br>

**Command pattern** <br>
Do you see any problems or annoyances in using this pattern?<br>
A lot of overhead which in addition to being annoying to write is also bad for readability.<br>
<br>
Find 1 example for our bank usecase<br>
Can be used for transactions so theres more control over their execution and undoing.<br>
<br>
Find 1 example outside of the bank usecase<br>
In an online shopping cart so the user can wait and buy a bunch of stuff at the same time.<br>
<br>

**Systems Modeling In Real Life** <br>
What is Ncameo?<br>
Ncameo is the premier "No-Code Application-Building Platform." So basically a platform that provides a good base for applications
businesses tend to need so they can be made without needing a whole specialist team.<br>
<br>
What are their services?<br>
They provide a platform for easy application development for Web and Mobile with Cloud support.<br>
<br>
What are your expectations rgd. Systems Modeling (what models/methods do you expect them to use)?<br>
I have no idea what they might use.<br>
<br>
<br>
What was most impressive, particular, insightful in Ncameo's history and current way of work?<br>
Starting from a pretty much working solutions when talking to the client<br>
<br>
How could Ncameo's No-Code environment been helpful building your class project?<br>
It probably would have reduced the amount of work a fair bit but im sure it would have also presented its own set of problems.<br>

#### Lecture reflection
The observer pattern and its relatedness to MVC was interesting to hear as we are using the MVC pattern in the bank project.

Hearing about Ncameo was interesting and i think it's at least in some ways good that the industry is moving more in that sort of
direction and it really makes sense that it would as well. I'm not quite sure what i really learned from it though.
