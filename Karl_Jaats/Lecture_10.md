### Lecture 10
#### Tasks
Why de we want/need design patterns?<br>
To write better code and create some standardisation.

#### Lecture reflection
I agree that in big projects Design patterns are very much important to have. They help organise the work and the code, which makes the work go 
smoother, the code quality better and maintaining it easier. In smaller projects it's not as nesessacy.

#### The Project
During the meeting there was a little problem of people not being active enough, including me. I think it might be a starting thing though and 
I think it'll get better.

In the meeting this week where we agreed on a bunch of stuff and set the project up. In addition I wrote some of the user stories out based on rough
notes from the meeting.
