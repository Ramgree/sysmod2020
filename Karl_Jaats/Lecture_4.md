### Lecture 4
#### Prep
##### Component diagrams
We made one of the con videos for this week. <br>

**Pros:**
* Great for planning the system implementation as it covers all the main parts without going into unnecessary detail.
* Purpose made for one job so fits that job well.<br>

**Cons:**
* The scope where they can be used is small as they are too abstract for some purposes and not abstract enough for others.
* In simpler systems all the necessary info can be figured out just from a class diagram making it unnecessary. <br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use in development to agree how the file system or database will be built to avoid confusion. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use it in a meeting with non technical people as they want a more general picture of the system and don't care about the extra detail. <br>

**Group 14: Component Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What is UML and how are the diagrams categorised, what are component diagrams and some notation, how to draw them. <br>

Strongest point: Supports reverse engineering

**Group 4: Component Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What is a component diagram and the notation of it <br>

Strongest point: Higher level view so makes what the code does more understandable

**Group 12: Component Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What is component diagram and some notation and relationships<br>

Strongest point: Difficult to maintain in dynamic systems
