### Lecture 3
#### Prep
##### Class Diagrams
**Pros:**
* Really close to implementation so it's easy to implement and reflects closely what is in the code
* Can be used as a base for other diagrams <br>

**Cons:**
* Can only be used for a small system/part of system, otherwise it gets really big and hard to grasp
* Not applicable to not object oriented solutions <br>

**Example 1:** When trying to design how the code will be structured in a part of a system it makes sense to make a class diagram to visualize it. <br>
**Example 2:** When using a not object oriented solution it doesn't make sense to try to force it into a class diagram. <br>

**Group 12: Class Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. Relationships in uml and in class diagrams specifically. Class diagram uses. How to derive a class diagram from an object diagram. Cardinality ratios. decorator pattern. <br>

Strongest point: Easy to read

**Group 7: Class Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. How to derive a class diagram from an object diagram. When to use class diagrams. Inheritance is not always good.<br>

Strongest point: 1 to 1 mapping with the implementation layer

**Group 2+6: Class Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. Relationsships in class diagrams. Inheritance is not always good. Cardinalities and their problems.<br>

Strongest point: Management and maintenance are time-consuming


#### Tasks
**What i thought was strange:**<br>
**Diagram 1**<br>
Associations because it being aggregation/composition means something else? - same as instructor

**Diagram 2**<br>
Attributes as the attribute and the object name are the same. - not the same

**Diagram 3**<br>
Seems alright to me. - obviously not the same

**Diagram 4**<br>
Object names could be more descriptive/unique as user1 etc isn't great - mentioned but debatable <br>
The attributes too as the ids aren't really very relavant for the diagram and clutter it up. They feel akward and very technical implementation level things that distract from how it works in the slightly bigger sense. - basically same as instructor

**Break up**<br>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MhcLcJJXjbwEdoixdQkuqPlu0njAoPBbztIrsWg5FE/edit# <br>
I was in group nr 6. <br>

I provided the pro that the class diagram can be used as a base for other more higher level diagrams.

#### Lecture reflection
It was alright. I still feel like the the benefits of the breakouts are not anywhere near as big as you think. In fact they are maybe a little waste of time in the learning sense though
they add some more social aspects to the class and maybe allow as to get to know eachother bit though as it is online it's very slight.
No real discussion really takes place there people just agree quickly on the first thing said just so the task gets done and something can be
written down.
