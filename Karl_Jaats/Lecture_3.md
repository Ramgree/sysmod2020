### Lecture 3
#### Prep
##### Class Diagrams
**Pros:**
* Really close to implementation so it's easy to implement and reflects closely what is in the code
* Can be used as a base for other diagrams <br>

**Cons:**
* Can only be used for a small system/part of system, otherwise it gets really big and hard to grasp
* Not applicable to not object oriented solutions <br>

**Example 1:** When trying to design how the code will be structured in a part of a system it makes sense to make a class diagram to visualize it. <br>
**Example 2:** When using a not object oriented solution it doesn't make sense to try to force it into a class diagram. <br>
