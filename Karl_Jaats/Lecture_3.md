### Lecture 3
#### Prep
##### Class Diagrams
**Pros:**
* Really close to implementation so it's easy to implement and reflects closely what is in the code
* Can be used as a base for other diagrams <br>

**Cons:**
* Can only be used for a small system/part of system, otherwise it gets really big and hard to grasp
* Not applicable to not object oriented solutions <br>

**Example 1:** When trying to design how the code will be structured in a part of a system it makes sense to make a class diagram to visualize it. <br>
**Example 2:** When using a not object oriented solution it doesn't make sense to try to force it into a class diagram. <br>

**Group 12: Class Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. Relationships in uml and in class diagrams specifically. Class diagram uses. How to derive a class diagram from an object diagram. Cardinality ratios. decorator pattern. <br>

Strongest point: Easy to read

**Group 7: Class Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. How to derive a class diagram from an object diagram. When to use class diagrams. Inheritance is not always good.<br>

Strongest point: 1 to 1 mapping with the implementation layer

**Group 2+6: Class Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: What are class diagrams. Relationsships in class diagrams. Inheritance is not always good. Cardinalities and their problems.<br>

Strongest point: Management and maintenance are time-consuming
