### Lecture 5
#### Prep
##### Use case diagrams
**Pros:**
* Helps to identify things that are influencing the system.
* Visualises and gives and overview of an otherwise pretty combersome thing.<br>

**Cons:**
* Just organising your use cases by different things gets similar results.
* Again gets pretty messy and unwieldy when there are a lot of use cases. <br>

**Example 1:** Makes sense to use after having first done the use cases to get an overview of what do they collectively say. <br>
**Example 2:** Doesn't make sense to use if you have a relatively small amount of use cases that can easily be divided based on actor or something as it doesn't add much. <br>

**Group 1: Use case Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what are use case diagrams, its components, whats a persona and why is it good <br>

Strongest point: Help understanding the requirements

**Group 3: Use case Diagrams Pro** <br>
Lessons learned: what are use case diagrams, its relation to user stories <br>

Strongest point: Helps with designing tests

**Group 11: Use case Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are use case diagrams and personas, how to draw use case diagrams, what are its components<br>

Strongest point: Can be relatively easily misunderstood

**Group 5: Use case Diagrams Con** <br>
Lessons learned: what are use cases, what use case diagrams are for, how to draw them, what's a persona<br>

Strongest point: Doesn't cover non-functional requirements
