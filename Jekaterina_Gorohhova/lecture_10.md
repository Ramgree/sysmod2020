# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 10 (10.11.2020)


#### Lecture reflection

I find design patterns theme extremely useful, even in smaller teams (where it ain't that necessary tho). If we can accelerate the development, why not? 
It also helps teams to communicate effectively and write better code.
 
#### Lab reflection

This time meeting was kinda okay, but I feel that we're stuck. Hopefully we will overcome that. 
I did participate in the meeting but not that much since I feel kinda insecure and not knowing much.
