#### Lecture reflection

Adam's presentation was well-done and interesting to listen. Much thanks!
 
#### Lab reflection

Somehow ended up tailoring the frontend stuff with the help of Rasul and Ida Maria (the Saints!). They really helped me a lot during those crazy weeks, and I talked almost to noone else in a team except of them.
The deadline is near and everybody is stressed out, but I believe that we'll do everything great. 
Found a nice soundtrack for a video, already started adjusting that (which in my case is cutting out and putting together cool parts).
