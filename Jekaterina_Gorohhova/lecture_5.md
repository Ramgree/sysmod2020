# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 5 (06.10.2020)

### Preparation

#### Use case diagrams pros

* Use case dia captures the users expectations so the end result is clear
* Understandable for people with non-technical background


#### Use case diagrams cons

* Done in free form - it's easy to misunderstand things
* Cannot be used for non-object-oriented solutions

Using use case dia makes sense when we need to show how user interacts with system. It doesn't make sense if the detailed system overview is needed - which parts are there, how do they interact, etc.


### Lecture tasks

I was moderator in a group nr 2.

2 Best For

* Point 1: Use-Case Persona provides situational awareness of a very specific user need, it becomes much easier to filter important decisions about the project with greater empathy for the userâ€™s perspective.
* Point 2: its very useful for the systems which are designed for the wide audience so we have to get familiarized with all types of users

2 Best Against

* Point 1: Interviews and analyzing them can take a lot of time, which is very problematic in a constantly changing environment that is the world today.
* Point 2: No value for developers


#### Lecture reflection

The discussion about who needs the systems modelling the most was fun and useful, it helped me to clear a mess in my own thoughts about that topic. 
 
#### Lab reflection

I had to visit my doctor at the same time when our lab was so I missed that one. I was almost all of the time talking to them at the discord chat tho, to provide at least some help.
