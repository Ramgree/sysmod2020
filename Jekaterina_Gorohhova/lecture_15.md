# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 15 (15.12.2020)

 
#### Reflection

So here are the final presentations! YAY! Every group did a great job! 
It was nice to compare our results. Everybody had such a great idea, and all applications were different from anothers. We all encountered lots of problems, from communication in teams during quarantine to software stuff. 
My all-time favourites were presentations made by team 1,11,7 and team 5,10. I want to make a podcast with a storyteller from team 5,10!!!

I also felt very nervous during our presentation since I had tough time editing our final video. I did want it to be perfect to represent our team's hard work during project weeks. I hope guys are also satisfied with the result.

To conclude, the Systems Modeling course taught me a lot and I can say without a doubt that for me personally this course was one of the most practical and useful courses of this semester. 
It seems to me that I will definitely need this knowledge in the future. Thanks Ulno and Ishaya for that great time!
