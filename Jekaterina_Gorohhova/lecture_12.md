# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 12 (24.11.2020)

#### Observer pattern

##### Problems

Can't think of any

##### Example in bank application

Event log

##### Example outside of bank application

Idk, maybe some validation fields? Like input fields for email, etc.

#### Command pattern

##### Problems

Can't think of any

##### Example in bank application

Mike Camara had a good point - we can save commands if the part of a platform is down and once it's up, execute them.

##### Example outside of bank application


#### Lecture reflection

I don't really understand command patterns, I need to spend some more time exploring them. 
 
#### Lab reflection

I try my best not to let the team down, but this has led to unexpected consequences. I concentrated too much on thinking through the design to the smallest detail, and it ended up with too little done by the deadline. I need to rethink my approach and stop worrying so much about the little things, missing the big picture.
