# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 11 (17.11.2020)


#### Lecture reflection

Had to miss the lecture due to visit to the doctor again. Hellish hell, when will it stop?
 
#### Lab reflection

This time we decided on what languages we will choose for the system and divided people in the team between frontend and backend teams. I got into the frontend team since I don't care what 
skills - frontend or backend, - to learn anyway (since I have no experience in both areas), but I'm into UI/UX and can help at least this way. I was scared to admit that I was unlikely to be able to help with writing the code, but everything went well, the team supported me.
