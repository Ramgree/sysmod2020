# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 3 (22.09.2020)

### Preparation

#### Class diagrams pros

* Clearly shows what shall be in the code
* Not that messy as object diagrams


#### Class diagrams cons

* Can get complicated easily and very fast
* Cannot be used for non-object-oriented solutions

Using CD makes sense when we need to show the overview of the system or its part. It doesn't make sense if the detailed view is needed.


### Lecture tasks

I was in a group nr 5.

2 Best For

* Point 1: Class Diagrams provide detailed insight into the system developed. It gives an overview of the whole system, its objects and the relationships between them.
* Point 2: When the developer creates the class diagram, they have already thought about the whole architecture of the code and they have a clear picture of how the code should look like and what it should do

2 Best Against

* Point 1: Maintenance of diagrams becomes expensive when the system is constantly changing
* Point 2: For complicated large scale systems, all the relationships, their meanings and notations can get complicated and the reader might need a key to even understand, what's going on in the class diagram


#### Lecture reflection

I really like the idea of prerecorded videos! It is just awesome. I often lose concentration and cannot focus on something for a long time, so this method just saves me, I can revise the part that I missed or did not understand at any time.
 
#### Lab reflection

This time we mostly discussed the video part, which is my time to shine. I like the process of video editing, so I volunteered to become a person who would put the parts of the final video together.
