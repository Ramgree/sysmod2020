# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 4 (29.09.2020)

### Preparation

#### Component diagrams pros

    Allow to see the whole project from a high level.
    Are useful for wide range of applications.
	
#### Component diagrams cons

	Impossible to show unmet requirements.
	For some tasks not abstract enough, for others are too abstract.
	
This week we had to record the video too, and the strongest arguments from our team are (as I see): 
	Impossibility to show unmet requirements
	It's really hard to do the component dia well.



### Lecture tasks


This time I was the person giving almost all the cons arguments in the team as I spent the whole night looking up for them all around the World Wide Web and felt the need to spread the knowledge.
Don't actually remember the team number, but we did a nice work together. I liked the words of wisdom by our team moderator tho :)




#### Lecture reflection

Sadly, all the thing I could think about this time was the component diagrams and it was hard for me to concentrate on the lecture theme. 
 
#### Lab reflection

It was a nice time working with my team, no harsh feelings about it.
