# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 8 (27.10.2020)

### Preparation

#### Activity diagrams pros

* Easy to understand
* If proper notation is used, can replace several other diagrams


#### Activity diagrams cons

* Might be unreasonably complex
* Sometimes redundant

Activity diagrams are good to show which actions need to be done in parallel. They are useless if it's already clear tho.

### Lecture tasks

Group nr 2.

2 Best For

* Point 1: AD-s are useful in business modelling since they are understandable for both business people and end users.
* Point 2: ADs are good for system validation.

2 Best Against

* Point 1: In trivial cases/systems, they can be redundant.
* Point 2: The diagrams are so user friendly so it can cause a temptation to make them very complex where all details are put in.


#### Lecture reflection

It's getting harder and harder for me to concentrate and participate. Topics are not that hard, but it's hard for me to talk somehow. 
 
#### Lab reflection

Still catching up on prev week's task. It's getting more clear tho.
