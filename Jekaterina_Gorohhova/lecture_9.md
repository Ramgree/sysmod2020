# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 9 (03.11.2020)

### Preparation

#### Deployment diagrams pros

* Show how hardware and software work together
* Show how external systems are involved


#### Deployment diagrams cons

* Lack of notation standards
* Can't show cloud environments

Deployment diagrams are extremely useful when there's need to show how soes the system work with different external parts. They're useless when the system is small and doesn't rely on external systems.

### Lecture tasks

#### Things team leaders (scrum master, product owner, architecture owner) do:

#### Architecture owner:
* Makes decisions on the stuff related to architecture with product owner and helps team in case of architecture related questions

#### Scrum master:
* Makes sure everybody is working on their task

#### Product owner:
* Makes decisions on system functionality and also answers the questions related to functionality

#### Lecture reflection

Teams are getting bigger, project is introduced, I'm a little bit scared. I never worked in real (or even "real" in educational manner) teams and I have no idea how it will work or what will be the challenges we will encounter. Hopefully
we'll manage to complete all the tasks.
 
#### Lab reflection

Ida Maria just saved this Event Storming. The whole team was just quiet for some time and it already started getting awkward when she took the initiative and suggested some ideas. Somehow we all started participating at some point and 
overall result was quite good.
