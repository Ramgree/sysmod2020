# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 13 (01.12.2020)


#### Lecture reflection

Didn't learn much during this lecture. I don't think I'll ever need to use Fulib, but if I will, I'll know something about it tho. 
 
#### Lab reflection

Drawing, drawing and drawing the design again, the whole week, almost every day, nothing else. I'll also need to edit our final video (3rd video for the team already), so I also started to think about some ideas for that.
