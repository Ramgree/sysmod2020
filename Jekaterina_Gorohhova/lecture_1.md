# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 1 (08.09.2020)

### Preparation

#### Which types of diagrams are mentioned in the talk?

UML, Homeless old C#, layered ones, and many-many other different types with fun names I don't actually remember.

#### What is the standard for modeling software mentioned in the movie?

UML

#### Why is nobody using it?

It's odd, complex and scary. It's also too low-level.

#### What is the model-code gap and what is the problem with it?

We need to create a model and a code, which correspond to each other. The problem is that sometimes they are done this way, that the architecture model and the actual source code are doing different things.

#### What do you personally think about layers for modeling software?

I don't really have any experience in modeling, but I like the moments when some abstract idea becomes concrete and understandable, and layers to me are there to be the first step in that way.

#### How do you think about Systems Modeling after watching this movie?

There's always need to keep in mind that this model you are creating needs to be implemented in software in the future. 

#### Anything else remarkable from the movie, we should share/discuss?

Following standards is good, but not enough to create a working software.

### Lecture tasks

#### Task 1 - Who are you?

#### What do you expect from Systems Modeling?

As a theorist, I like to create models more than real products, and I also tend to forget about what should have been created in the first place, diving into the details. I want to learn how to cover the whole project in general, while at the same time not losing focus on the details.

#### Which SW architectures/modeling techniques have you already worked with?

I have literally no experience, except some half-esoteric half-intuitive modeling methods invented by my sleepy mind during some courses and writing thesis in BCs in order not to get lost into own system that had to be created.

#### Who are you, why are you studying in SE master?

I'm Jekaterina, the 1st year of SE. I liked programming since middle school and I want to learn how to create big, powerful and (which is most important for me) extremely beautiful systems.

#### What are your sw development skills?

I know some Java, some Python, some Brainfuck just for having fun (sorry for the word, but that's its actual name... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and the whole 10 years of trying to develop something using Delphi.

#### What are your weaknesses regarding sw development?

I am more an artist than a worker. The success of what I write often depends on inspiration. I would like to learn how to write code despite my condition.



#### Task 2 - What is software architecture?

#### What is Software Architecture?

Architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution. [IEEE 1471] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/feb06/eeles/index.html)

#### Lecture reflection

First lectures are usually a huge mess, especially in online form, as all the systems need to be tailored and all bunch of students need to understand what is needed for the course and where to find it.
I personally like the idea of using Discord, it's much comfortable than, for example, Slack or having all the needed stuff in MS Teams. Although, there are some stuff to be changed yet, like the temporary channels to be deleted. They are all public and it creates tons of unnecessary notifications.
Compared to other classes though I find the organization of the lectures rather good. 
 
#### Lab reflection

Again, the lab felt like a mess, which is ordinary for the first one here in university. Some tasks were rather boring, some of them were pretty interesting - but all of them felt like they need more time to complete than was announced during the lab.
