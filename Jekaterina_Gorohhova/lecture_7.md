# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 7 (20.10.2020)

### Preparation

#### State charts pros

* Can be used to generate code
* Make complex processes easier to understand


#### State charts cons

* Require a lot of states and events to be shown so designing something big will be a disaster
* Notation can bring confusion

Showing the entire big complex system using the state charts is nonsense, however, it is useful when showing the parts of this system and developing the requirements.

### Lecture tasks

Group nr 3.

2 Best For

* Point 1: Model-checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification. This is typically associated with hardware or software systems. It can also be used for testing.
* Point 2: Certain problems can become apparent before coding like dead ends. If we map states, it becomes easy to see whatâ€™s going on. This is specially important for security critical systems. If something goes wrong, it can be a disaster.

2 Best Against

* Point 1: They can get messy because there are many states involved. And It can become hard to read. Maintenance of diagrams is very difficult.
* Point 2: I think something was mentioned about how it is quite easy to create an incomplete state diagram if you forget to consider some transition for a certain combination of inputs. And some errors can come from there, if you're using this as a basis for code or creating code directly from that.


#### Lecture reflection

I didn't take the notes this time, so I don't remember much. All that I do remember is that I've felt lost at some point of the discussion in bbb, this time everybody were just talking at the same time. TOO MESSY.
 
#### Lab reflection

Finally some time to catch up! 
It's a good idea since I've already lost the track. That extra time could be of help.
