# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 6 (13.10.2020)

### Preparation

#### Sequence diagrams pros

* Can represent the passage of time and show the order of operations
* Helps to coordinate between teams


#### Sequence diagrams cons

* Can take REALLY much space
* Can be hard to understand for people without technical background

Using use case dia makes sense when we need to show how user interacts with system. It doesn't make sense if the detailed system overview is needed - which parts are there, how do they interact, etc.


### Lecture tasks

#### What other artifacts could help communicate with the user/customer?

Prototypes can help the customer "feel" the system - is this what he neeeds or does he need something else? What could be done differently? It's easier to comment such details out by just showing concrete things, not trying to explain something abstractly, only by words.

#### Software tools vs paper?

Using some software for creating mockups for me is much easier and convenient. Paperworks are usually messy and require tons of time in case you do any mistake to fix it, especially if you need to redo the whole thing - then it becomes a disaster. Software tools are much easier 
in use, but they do require a little bit of skills to create something unique - but same can be said about paper prototypes (drawing skills, meh). It's also more convenient to use special software if you're doing this work in team - this way
everybody can work independently on the same project. Mockups created by using some tools also looks more polished and clear. 


#### Lecture reflection

I personally prefer using software tools for creating the mockups. I also have completed the UI/UX design related subjects where I've got hands-on experience on how it's done and from my own perspective I'd use
paper only for drawing something really quick to discuss that with a team and later re-draw that using tools, otherwise the mockup will look messy and dirty.
 
#### Lab reflection

1.5h full of struggling with the tasks and teamwork, nothing really interesting. I'm lost in discord chat and I don't have much to say. :<
