# Systems Modeling 2020

## Lecture 2 (15.09.2020)

### Preparation

#### Object diagrams pros

* Easy to implement
* Easy to understand for people without technical background


#### Object diagrams cons

* Can only be used for smaller systems/parts of systems, otherwise they get really complex
* Too detailed


### Lecture tasks

I was a moderator in Breakout C. 

2 Best For
* ODs are easy to implement
* ODs are concrete and extremely easy to read and understand 

2 Best Against
* ODs are hardly doable for large systems
* ODs wonâ€™t work for non-object oriented solutions


#### Lecture reflection

It seems that this time people already started to understand how everything works so the work goes much faster (almost like red things in Warhammer). Lecture also was smooth and clear. 
 
#### Lab reflection

As for an introvert who does not like to crawl out of his little world, it is always difficult for me to work in a group. However, this time, I came across an extremely nice team. We get along well, and I hope it will last until the semester ends (or even longer, that could be fun).
